## ⚙️ How to Run These Projects

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/IrfanaAslam/my-python-beginner-projects.git](https://github.com/IrfanaAslam/my-python-beginner-projects.git)
    ```
    (Note: The repository name `my-python-beginner-projects` is a suggestion. If your repository is just `Python`, adjust the `git clone` command accordingly.)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-python-beginner-projects
    ```
    (Adjust this if your repository name is different, e.g., `cd Python`)

3.  **Run a specific project:**
    Choose the project file you want to run (e.g., `project_01_hello_greeting.py`) and execute it using Python:
    ```bash
    python project_01_hello_greeting.py
    ```

4.  **Follow the prompts:** The program will typically ask you for input in the terminal.
